# Overview

This repository contains the code that I wrote for my thesis work: **Data visualization in a Smart City contest: the #SmartME project**.

*#SmartME: sensors* (part of the  *[#SmartME](http://smartme.unime.it/)* project) collects real-time data on the city environment. The implemented heatmap-based visualization layer provides a quick and intuitive access to information.
